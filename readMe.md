# Amazon Smile Redirector

## Description

This is a basic Chrome plugin, which redirects you to the subdomain smile.amazon.com everytime you visit amazon.com. The plugin should support additional local domains such as .co.uk.

## Benefit

The main benefit here was to understand a little further how a browser plugin works, so this simple example gave me a little idea of how to put one together. 

For purchases made through **Smile Amazon**, Amazon will donate 0.5% of the purchase price of eligible products to the charitable organization of your choice. Therefore, the plugin serves a practical purpose for me, while I regularly buy items from Amazon, through habit I often just go to the regular Amazon domain, rather the Smile Amazon domain.
